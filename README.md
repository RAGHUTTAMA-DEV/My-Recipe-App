"This is the basic backend for my Recipe App. I'm just a week into learning the MERN stack, so Iâ€™ve kept it simple as a starting point. I know there are many improvements I can make, like using Zod, hashing passwords with Argon, implementing cookies, CORS, and moreâ€”but for now, this serves as the foundation. Excited to build and upload the full project with the frontend soon!"

Let me know if you'd like any tweaks! ðŸš€
